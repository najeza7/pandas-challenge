# pandas-challenge
# by Elena Sánchez Nájera

Here you can find the jupyter notebook for the pandas challenge, I chose the Heroes of Pymoli Challenge.

While I was doing the challenge I found out the following trends based on the data provided:
  
   * Most of the players are men, and because of that they are the ones that bought the most in total. But even if the men played more,
     we can observe that women tend to have an individual average purchase greater than the individual average purchase of men, so we can 
     conclude that women spend more.
   
   * Almost half of the players are between the ages of 20 and 24 years old, but on average the ones that spend more are between the ages of 
    35 and 39 years old, maybe we can explain this because older guys are more likely to work and have a greater purchasing power 
    than the younger players.
   
   * When we compare the lists of most popular items with the list of most profitable items, we can observe that the first two items are the
   same for both lists, so we can suspect that being a popular item is related to being a profitable item.
